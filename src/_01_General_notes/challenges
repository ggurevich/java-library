Today you will be working off a video tutorial of your choice.
There are three videos and are of varying demand.  A key component
to growing as a developer is to become aware of where you are in your
understanding.  Each of these apps will challenge you and reinforce 
your understanding.  However, choosing one that is too difficult or
too easy will not foster growth.  Therefore, we have categorized these
tutorials as Bronze, Silver, and Gold.  Below is a brief description.

****It is important to note that these tutorials will
incorporate concepts not yet covered in class - this is common as a 
developer.  I normally research a new concept then I will place
comments in my code so I can reference what I've learned.  
You can also add another package in your Java-Library project
and play around with a concept. For instance, you'll see try/catch
in the Bronze project.****

For this project you will need to use repl.it
If you have not done so, please create a repl account. 
This is an example of a tic tac toe app in repl.  Ethan has worked
on this and there are some awesome concepts included.  Use ths to see
how repl works.  Also, going through his repl and commenting on the 
code is a great way to warm up your mind for the day.  I would 
encourage you to take 5-10 minutes and do this but don't spend too
long on this.

The repls you create will be a way to have console apps you've built
be available on your portfolio. 

STEP 1 - Read through and Choose one of these apps:

1.  Calculator Console App (Bronze)
	Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZkj7MMwjNA
	-uses classes and switches.
	-great choice to reinforce OOP and some different logic
	 we have gone over in class.
	 
2.  Gradebook Console App (Silver)
	Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBfBvqg9qhc
	-uses data collections, especially ArrayLists.
	-also great to reinforce while loops and nested conditionals
	
3.  Blackjack Console App (Gold)
	Link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLhgqPUHoVs
	-similar to the Calculator and Gradebook but OOP and logic is
	 expanded as complexity has increased.
	 
STEP 2 - Build the console app following the tutorial
         Make sure to research new concepts and to annotate your
         code so you can demonstrate understanding

STEP 3 - By yourself or with a partner(if partner make sure you are
		 both completing the same tutorial) think of ways to improve
		 upon this tutorial build.  For example, the gradebook app
		 is great but what if we wanted to attach the grades to a 
		 student id or student name?

STEP 4 - Pair Program with your partner or work by yourself and make
         any changes you would like.  At this time, you may want to
         completely branch in a new direction and take what you have
         learned and create something totally new!
